                        <li>
                            <p><b>What are the visa and/or passport requirements for Mexico?</b></p>
                            <p>Travel to Mexico requires valid passports, even for US Citizens. Please ensure that your passport expires after October 12, 2019 (6 months from the date of entry into Mexico).</p>
                            <p>Mexico has no visa requirement for US Citizens, but you will be asked to fill out an FMM form (Mexico's visitor permit) on the plane or once you land. Once you get to immigration and customs at Cancún airport, the agents will give you the bottom half to retain until you leave the country. It is VERY important to keep this secure until you leave Mexico.</p>

                            <p><b>Can I stay for just 2 nights?</b></p>
                            <p>While most destination wedding guests choose to stay 3-5 nights when flying to Mexico, we understand there may be certain limiting factors. Unfortunately, group discounts are only valid on a minimum of 3-night stays. </p>
                            <p>If you must stay 2 nights, please contact Shaadi Destinations by emailing hello@shaadidestinations.com with the subject line Ricky & Keya. Booking through Shaadi Destinations allows for certain group benefits to be conveyed and allows for the best rate possible.</p>
